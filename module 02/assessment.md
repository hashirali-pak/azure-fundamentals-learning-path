## Key Learnings
- Availability Sets ensure high availability for Azure VMs by distributing them across fault domains (hardware redundancy) and update domains (staggered maintenance), minimizing downtime during failures or updates.
- Azure Virtual Desktop provides a cloud-hosted Windows experience accessible from any device via browsers or clients, eliminating the need for local VM management.
- Route-based VPN gateways are the flexible choice for connecting Azure networks, supporting advanced scenarios like VNet-to-VNet, point-to-site, and ExpressRoute coexistence, unlike restrictive policy-based gateways.
